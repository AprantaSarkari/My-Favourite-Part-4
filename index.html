        <p>“A room without books is like a body without a soul.” I can so relate to this. You see, I just love books. I like spending my free time on books of all types of books as they give you so much knowledge. They are so interesting that I just dive into that book and forget all about my surroundings. It is a very good habit and best of all, anyone of any age can read it. I started reading from a very young age and they are my best friends. Reading books helps you a lot and keeps you happy and it is an excellent source of inspiration and imagination.
            One of my most favourite books are the Harry Potter series.
